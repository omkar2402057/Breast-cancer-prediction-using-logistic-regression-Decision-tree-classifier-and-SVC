# Breast-cancer-prediction-using-logistic-regression-Decision-tree-classifier-and-SVC
This project implements a breast cancer detection system using machine learning algorithms. It uses the breast cancer dataset to classify tumors as either benign or malignant. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

The accuracies obtained by the above algorithms are as follows:

Logistic Regression — 98.70%
Decision Tree Algorithm — 94.33%
Support Vector Machines — 96.89%
